I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). As a member of [ProSE](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~prose/), I'm supervised by [Prof. Ningning Xie](https://xnning.github.io/) and [Prof.Fan Long](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fanl/).

Previously, I visited [UC Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/) for a research internship supervised by [Prof. Yu Feng](https://fredfeng.github.io/). I did my B.Eng. in Computer Science at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), where I worked with [Prof. Qinxiang Cao](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/people/members/faculty/qinxiang-cao.html) on compiler correctness verification.

I'm generally interested in *Programming Languages* concepts and techniques that helps people build *sound* and *efficient* softwares, especially in a *principal* way.

To be specific, I'm currently exploring topics like:
- Beautiful and practical *type theory and systems* (e.g. row poly, linear types, etc.)
- Interesting *language features* (e.g. staging, effect) done in a type-safe way
