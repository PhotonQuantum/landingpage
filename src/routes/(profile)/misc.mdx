This website is *mutual-recursively* designed by myself and my friend [Matchy](https://matchy.bio/) :span[(We regularly borrow designs from each other)]{.text-gray-500}.
Also, it's inspired by [skyzh/skyzh-site](https://github.com/skyzh/skyzh-site) and [jonbarron/website](https://github.com/jonbarron/website).

#### Languages

I speak Mandarin, Shanghainese and English. Also, I can understand a little bit of Japanese. I prefer Shanghainese over Mandarin if you can speak it :span[(阿拉要保护好阿拉自家个闲话!)]{.text-gray-500}.

#### Traveling

I enjoy hiking and traveling. I've been to many places in China, US, Canada, and Japan.

#### Music

I used to listen to a lot of J-pop and J-rock, but now I'm more into *pop* and *rock*. I also like some classical music.

Recently I've found myself hooked on musicals. Can't wait to see *Come From Away*!

#### Keyboards

- Lofree Flow84 (Kailh Low-profile :span[Ghost]{.text-lime-700})
- HHKB Pro 2 (with [YDKB BLE Mod](https://ydkb.io/help/#/en/keyboards/hhkb-ble))

#### One More Thing

This site is now built with [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) because I recently found that [a talented student](https://github.com/milomg) of CSC324 is a core contributor to this project. He taught me a lot about incremental computation, and I trust his expertise.
