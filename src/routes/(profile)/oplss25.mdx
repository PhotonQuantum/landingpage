Iâ€™ll be attending **OPLSS 2025** in Eugene, Oregon from *June 23* to *July 5*!

If youâ€™re also going, Iâ€™d love to connect and chat, about programming languages, type systems, or anything else that comes up.

### Schedule

I'm travelling from *YYZ* to *PDX*, then driving to *Eugene* on *June 22*. I'll be around the campus except for weekends.

Note that I'll be leaving one day early on *July 5* due to high flight prices ðŸ˜­.

### Where to Find Me

- Official OPLSS sessions
- Around the campus
- If there's any social outings, I'll likely be there, except for the last day
